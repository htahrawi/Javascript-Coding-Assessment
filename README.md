# JavaScript Coding Assessment Projects â€“ Code2Career (Gaza Sky Geeks)

This repository contains three JavaScript-based projects created as part of a personal coding assessment to apply for the **Code2Career training program** at **Gaza Sky Geeks**.

## ðŸ“Œ Projects Included

1. **Build Chrome Extension**  
   A simple Chrome extension built with JavaScript to practice event handling, storage, and user interaction within the browser environment.

2. **Subway Passenger Counter (Basic)**  
   A lightweight counter app designed to track passengers entering or exiting a subway â€” built using basic JavaScript DOM manipulation.

3. **Subway Passenger Counter (Enhanced)**  
   An improved version of the passenger counter with cleaner UI and modular code.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

These projects were developed for practice and demonstration purposes as part of my application to the **Code2Career** program. They reflect my current JavaScript skill set and my enthusiasm to grow further in web development.
